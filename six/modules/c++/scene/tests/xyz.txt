# This is a test file for the geometry model.  Its keys are the
# names of the keys in a common.support dictionary, so that we
# can easily get our geometry model to interpret them.
#
# Comments are delimited with hash, and values have commas with
# no spaces in between array values
#
# These particular values come from the Hydra imagery in CIQM's
# test area. (/net/csd880a/var2/u/ciqm)

# WRA_.6844L0001.vv04.hydra
#
# Note that, for this series of images, IDP is the slant plane
# so we use the FP for everything

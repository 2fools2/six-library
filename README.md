##What Six does

This library consists of reference implementations ..... 

###Origin

Six Library was developed at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) in collaboration with [MDA Information Systems](http://www.mdaus.com/). The government has "unlimited rights" and is releasing this software to increase the impact of government investments by providing developers with the opportunity to take things in new directions. The software use, modification, and distribution rights are stipulated within the LGPL 3.0 license.

The SIX library is a cross-platform C++ API for reading and writing NGA's complex (SICD) and derived (SIDD) sensor independent radar formats. Additionally it is the official reference implementation library for the SIDD format. The library also provides a sensor model implementation of many equations in the SICD and SIDD document; see https://github.com/ngageoint/six-library/wiki. 

It is available as open-source software under the Lesser GNU Public License (LGPL). This license is commonly used in the open-source community, and allows applications that are not open source to make use of the library without penalty. As with other open source projects, the library is available as-is, with no warranty. 

See the manual for detailed information including build instructions and API documentation: https://github.com/ngageoint/six-library/blob/master/docs/six-docbook.pdf

The latest version of the library is available at https://github.com/ngageoint/six-library.git
